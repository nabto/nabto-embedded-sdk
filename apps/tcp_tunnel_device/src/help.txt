TCP Tunnel Device Help.

# Arguments.
  -h, --help          Print help
  -v, --version       Print version
  -H, --home-dir      Set alternative home dir, The default home dir is
                      $HOME/.nabto/edge on linux and mac, and %APPDATA%\nabto\edge
                      on windows
      --log-level     Set the log level for the application the possible levels
                      is error, warn, info and trace.
      --random-ports  Bind the local and the p2p sockets to random UDP ports
                      instead of the default UDP ports 5592 and 5593.
      --local-port    Bind the local socket to a specific UDP port instead of
                      the default UDP port 5592.
      --p2p-port      Bind the p2p socket to a specific UDP port instead of the
                      default UDP port 5593
      --init          Interactively create configuration files the the tcp tunnel.
      --demo-init     Interactively initialize the TCP tunnel for demo purposes.
                      This option should be used if a quick proof of concept needs
                      to be made for demo purposes. This should not be used in a
                      production setup.

                      Below are several options which can be used to limit the memory
                      usage of a device.
      --limit-connections
                      Limit the max number of concurrent nabto connections which a
                      device accepts.
      --limit-streams Limit the max number of concurrent nabto streams the Device
                      can handle. Each tunnel connection e.g. tcp connection accounts
                      for one stream.
      --limit-stream-segments
                      Limit the total number of segments used concurrently by the
                      streaming layer. Each segment consumes roughly 256bytes ram.


# Files

The application uses several files. They are located in subfolders of
the homedir: config, state and keys.

The files are by default located in this folder on unix:
`$HOME/.nabto/edge` and this on Windows `%APPDATA%\nabto\edge`. The location can
be overriden by the home-dir option. In this case basefolder is
`${home-dir}`.

## `config/device.json`

A configuration file containing the configuration for the device. This
includes the product id, device id and the host names of servers.

The format of the json file is
```
{
  "ProductId": "pr-abcd1234",
  "DeviceId": "de-abcd1234",
  "Server": "optional server hostname",
  "ServerPort": "optional port number for the server"
}
```

The `ProductId` in the configuration is the product which is
configured for the group of devices. The product id is found in the cloud
console.

The `DeviceId` is the device id for this specific device. This device
id found in the cloud console.

The `Server` is an optional hostname of the server the device uses. If
not set, the default server is used.

## `config/tcp_tunnel_device_iam_config.json`

The `tcp_tunnel_iam.json` is an IAM policies file which contains the
policies and roles used by the system.

Read more about the IAM module on http://docs.nabto.com/developer/guides/iam/intro.html.

## `state/tcp_tunnel_device_iam_state.json`

A file containing the state of the application, this file is written
by the application. A custom state file can be added to devices in
production such that the devices comes e.g. with some default state.

## `keys/device.key`

The device key file is created if it does not exist.
