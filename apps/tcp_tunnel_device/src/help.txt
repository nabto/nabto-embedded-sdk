# Files

The application uses several files. The are located in subfolders of
the homedir. Namely config, state and keys.

The files is by default located in the folder unix:
`$HOME/.nabto/edge`, windows `%APPDATA%\nabto\edge`. The location can
be overriden by the home-dir option. In this case basefolder is
`${home-dir}`.

## `config/device.json`

A configuration file containing the configuration for the device. This
includes the product id, device id and the host names of servers.

The format of the json file is
```
{
  "ProductId": "pr-abcd1234",
  "DeviceId": "de-abcd1234",
  "Server": "optional server hostname",
  "ServerPort": "optional port number for the server"
}
```

The `ProductId` in the configuration is the product is which is
configured for the group of devices. The product id found in the cloud
console.

The `DeviceId` is the device id for this specific device. This device
id found in the cloud console.

The `Server` is an optional hostname of the server the device uses. It
not set the default server is used.

## `config/tcp_tunnel_device_iam_config.json`

The `tcp_tunnel_iam.json` is an IAM policies file which contains the
