 * Nabto Device High Level C Api.
 *
 * Nabto provides a platform for connecting applications with
 * devices. The platform consists of three major parts.
 *
 * Vocabulary:
 *
 * Client: Clients are often apps where the nabto_client library is
 * embedded inside. The clients can make connections to devices. Using
 * the servers.
 *
 * Device: Devices is often embedded devices running the Nabto
 * Embedded SDK, e.g. a heating control system or an ip camera. A
 * device instance can be created by this api.
 *
 * Server: Servers are hosted in datacenters and makes it possible to
 * create connections between the clients and devices.

/********************
 * FCM notifications
 ********************/

/**
 * @intro FCM Notifications
 *
 * Integration with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) notifications allows the device to send push
 * notifications to typically mobile clients. For a thorough introduction and a full example, see
 * the [Nabto Edge Push guide](https://docs.nabto.com/developer/guides/push/overview.html).
 *
 * The integration is transparent meaning the Nabto platform forwards the provided payload directly
 * to FCM, and so it must follow the format defined by FCM. Sending push notifications requires a
 * Firebase project as outlined in the [Nabto Edge Push
 * guide](https://docs.nabto.com/developer/guides/push/fcm-setup.html).
 *
 * Sending a notification from the device is initiated by the device creating a
 * NabtoDeviceFcmNotification object. Then the payload and project ID must be
 * set on the object before sending.
 *
 * When the send function is called, the device will send the notification to
 * the Nabto Basestation which forwards it to FCM through its REST API.
 *
 * When FCM has provided a response, the basestation returns the response to the
 * device, and the NabtoDeviceFuture of the send function resolves. Now the FCM
 * status code and response body can be read from the notification
 * object. Finally, the notification object must be freed.
 *
 * To setup FCM in your project, follow the general guidelines from Google. You must allow Nabto to
 * send push notifications through your FCM project:
 *
 * 1. Login to the Google Cloud Console
 *
 * 2. Open the "IAM & Admin" page
 *
 * 3. Add the Nabto Edge push service account `sender@nabto-fcm-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com` as a
 * member with the role “Firebase SDK Provisioning Service Agent”.
 *
 * In the last step, the only permission needed is `cloudmessaging.messages.create` so you can also

/******************
 * TCP Tunnelling
 ******************/

/**
 * @intro TCP Tunnelling
 *
 * TCP tunnelling allows clients to tunnel TCP traffic over a Nabto
 * connection to the device. The TCP Tunnel module uses the
 * Authorization API to determine if actions are allowed on a given
 * connection. An Authorization Request listener must therefore be
 * configured when using TCP tunnelling. It is recomended to use the
 * [Nabto IAM module](/developer/guides/iam/intro.html) to handle
 * Authorization Requests.
 *
 * A TCP tunnel client first makes a CoAP request: `GET
 * /tcptunnels/connect/:serviceId` - this will check that the given
 * connection is authorized to create a connection to the specific TCP
 * Service and return the `StreamPort` the client needs to use for
 * that connection.
 *
 * Later, when a TCP connection is made through the client, a new
 * stream is created to the `StreamPort` obtained in the previous
 * step. When this happens, the device makes another authorization
 * request which again checks that the given connection is allowed to
 * connect to the specific TCP Service.
 *
 * The TCP tunnelling module has the following authorization actions:
 *
 * ```
 * Actions:
 *  TcpTunnel:ListServices  CoAP request to list services
 *  TcpTunnel:GetService    CoAP request to get information for a specific service
 *  TcpTunnel:Connect       See note below
 * ```
 *
 * Note on the `TcpTunnel:Connect` action: When used in CoAP context,
 * it is used to test permissions for establishing a stream connection
 * and to get information about the connection. When used in Streaming
 * context, it is used to authorize an actual stream connection.
 *
 * The TCP Tunnelling module has the following authorization attributes:
 *
 * ```
 * Attributes:
 *   TcpTunnel:ServiceId   The id of the service.
 *   TcpTunnel:ServiceType The type of the service.
 * ```

/******************************
 * Password Authentication API
 ******************************/

/**
 * @intro Password Authentication
 *
 * This API allows password authentication of client and device. Note that
 * instead of using this low-level API, it is recommended for applications to
 * use the Nabto Edge IAM Module
 * (https://docs.nabto.com/developer/api-reference/embedded-device-sdk/iam/intro.html). That
 * module implements our recommended best practices where password based
 * authentication is only used for bootstrapping (pairing), instead using public
 * key authentication subsequently.
 *
 * Password authentication is bidirectional and based on PAKE, such that both
 * the client and the device learns that the other end knows the password,
 * without revealing the password to the other end. Only one password
 * authentication listener can exist on the system. The Nabto IAM module can be
 * used to handle password authorization requests.
 *
 * Internally, the Nabto device core supports PAKE through CoAP endpoints. Access to these endpoints
 * are throttled if a client provides an invalid username/password to prevent brute force password
 * cracks. Throttling is done using a token bucket of size 10 and rate 1. This allows 10 incorrect
 * attempts without throttling, after which only 1 attempt pr. second is allowed. After 10 seconds
 * of inactivity, the token bucket is fully replenished. Throttled requests are rejected with status
 * code 429.
 *
 * Usage:
 *  1. Create a new listener. nabto_device_listener_new()
 *  2. Init the listener to listen for password_authentication_requests. nabto_device_password_authentication_request_init_listener()
 *  3. Listen for events on the listener. nabto_device_listener_new_password_authentication_request()
 *  4. Handle the password authentication request
 *  4a. Get the username used for the request. nabto_device_password_authentication_request_get_username()

 * @intro Listeners
 *
 * Nabto Edge uses `Futures` to manage return values and completion of asynchronous API-functions; a
 * future resolves once such function has completed. Additionally, the Listener API supports
 * asynchronous functions that are expected to be invoked recurringly (see the [Futures
 * Guide](/developer/platforms/embedded/nabto_futures.html) for details).
 *
 * Listeners are created and freed through this general API. Once created, a listener is initialized
 * for use with a specific purpose, e.g. to listen for [incoming coap
 * requests](/developer/api-reference/embedded-device-sdk/coap/nabto_device_coap_init_listener.html),
 * [incoming requests](/developer/api-reference/embedded-device-sdk/streams/nabto_device_stream_init_listener.html)
 * or [general device
 * events](/developer/api-reference/embedded-device-sdk/context/nabto_device_device_events_init_listener.html).
