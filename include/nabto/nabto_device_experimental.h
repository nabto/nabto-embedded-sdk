/**
 * Set a private key for the device.
 *
 * An ecc key pair consists of a private key and a public key. For the
 * ECC group secp256r1 there is an element G which is a generator for
 * the group. The public key is simple k*G, where k is the private key
 * and a simple number. The argument given to this function is the 32
 * bytes which a private key consists of.
 *
 * These bytes can be found using openssl ec -in key.pem -text and
 * looking into the `priv:` section or using an asn1 parser. Or they
 * can be generated.
 *
 * Not all 32 byte strings are valid private keys. The range of valid
 * private keys for secp256r1 are [1,n-1] where n = FFFFFFFF 00000000
